Try conv_next
Enhance ResNet (epoches)

ResNet results:
ResNet-18,34,50 -- worked well
ResNet-101,152(worst) -not so well


conv_next results:
tried_tiny with epoches=10, should try by epoche=8
tried_base with epoches=10 bad
tried_large time large so not good
tried_tiny-train_acc=89.31, kaggle=0.46960


conv_next_small:
for epoches=11: overfit acc=90; kaggle=0.505
for epoches=10; acc=80; kaggle=0.52
epoches=9; kaggle:0.49626

conv_next_basic:
for epoches=11;kaggle=0.51040
for epoches=10;kaggle=0.52746
next try epoches=9,kaggle=0.503
epoches=8, kaggle=0.470


dense_net_121:
epoches=8, kaggle=0.49760 rest all bad


Batch_Size=64,224,224--tried with conv_next_tiny
epoches=9, kaggle=0.51680



Kaggles:
ResNet-18 submitted --done completely
ResNet-34 submitted --done completely
ResNet-50 submitted --done completely
ResNet-101 submitted --done completely

conv_next_tiny ambigous-again
conv_next_small submitted-submit- once more
conv_next_basic submitted-once submit again-try again
